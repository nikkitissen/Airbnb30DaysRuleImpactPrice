# How does Amsterdam's 30-day rule impact AirBnB prices?

To what extent does the announcement of the 30-day rule impact the Airbnb housing price in Amsterdam?

## Motivation

With the introduction of the 30-day rule, renters have less time to cover their related expenses. Hence, it is logical that the prices rise. But does the announcement indeed have a significant effect? If so, how much do the prices rise?

## Method and results

To analyse whether the announcement of the 30-day rule has a significant effect on the housing price of Airbnb houses, an event study will be conducted. With a window of 14 days before the announcement and 30 days after, it will be analysed whether the announcement has a significant effect.

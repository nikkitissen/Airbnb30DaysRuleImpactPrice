# How does Amsterdam's 30-days rule impact AirBnB prices?

To what extent does the announcement of the [30-day rule](https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-10-amsterdam-airbnb-rental-30-day-limit.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACSA-L7X_l1GZsI5sgU9BXuy4sX6EUP0fkHapl0HKwO4zOPZJ0MEeLZIDhIEoE2g32AcAW_jcdybRXXK3YddeFH0q7ZTXtKFqS8m67DWMjanp-rGH2kTTv7Ejf6HtuI0Pq6qQ4WHOszvmWAPzwccfirxqzsRSgymmuTnM2rpWr9h)
 impact the Airbnb housing price in Amsterdam? This study will be conducted by comparing Amsterdam, where the 30-day rule is active, with Brussel, where they do not have a 30-day rule.

## Motivation

With the introduction of the 30-days rule, renters have less time to cover their related expenses. Hence, it is logical that the prices rise. But does the announcement indeed have a significant effect? If so, how much do the prices rise?

## Method and results

To analyse whether the announcement of the 30-day rule has a significant effect on the housing price of Airbnb houses, an event study will be conducted. With a window of 14 days before the announcement and 30 days after, it will be analysed whether the announcement has a significant effect.
